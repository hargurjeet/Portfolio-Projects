# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files.

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Abalone Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Abalone-Dataset/Abalone_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb): A regression model to predict the age of abalone on the given objective measures. 
	- [Bank Note Dateset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Bank-Note-Dataset/Bank_Note_Analysis.ipynb): The Banknote Dataset involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 1,372 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable.
	- [Swedish Auto Insurance Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Swedish-Auto-Insurance-Dataset/Swedish_Auto_Insurance_Dataset.ipynb): The Swedish Auto Insurance Dataset involves predicting the total payment for all claims in thousands of Swedish Kronor, given the total number of claims.It is a regression problem.The model performance of predicting the mean value is an RMSE of approximately 118 thousand Kronor.
	- [Wine Quality Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Wine-Quality-Dataset/Wine_Quality_Dataset.ipynb): The Wine Quality Dataset involves predicting the quality of white wines on a scale given chemical measures of each wine.
	- [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset/Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Dataset.ipynb): The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values.The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 65%. I achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 77%.
	- [Sonar Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Sonar-Dataset/Sonar_Dataset.ipynb): The Sonar Dataset involves the prediction of whether or not an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles.It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced.The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 53%. I achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 938%.
	- [Ionosphere Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Sonar-Dataset/Sonar_Dataset.ipynb): The Ionosphere Dataset requires the prediction of structure in the atmosphere given radar returns targeting free electrons in the ionosphere.There are 351 observations with 34 input variables and 1 output variable. I have achieved the classifcation accuracy of 93%.
	- [Wheat Seeds Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Wheat-Seeds/Wheat_Seeds_Analysis_Pytorch.ipynb): The Wheat Seeds Dataset involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat.
	- [Califonia Housing Dataset](https://github.com/hargurjeet/MachineLearning/blob/Califonia-Housing-Dataset/Califonia_Housing_Analysis.ipynb): The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. The object is to identify the median housing value in that area. This is a regression problem

- ### DeepLearning

- #### PyTorch
  - [Wheat Seed Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/Wheat_Seeds_Analysis_Pytorch_blogs.ipynb): The datasets involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat. I build a logistic regression model and achievied accruacy of 78% under 15 epcohs.
  - [Insurance Cost Predicition](): I am going to use information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills.The dataset for this problem is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). 


- #### Tensorflow
Project updates in progress

- ### Natural Language Processing


	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- [Zomato Resturant Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/Data-Analysis-Using-Python/blob/main/Zomato%20Restaurant%20Analysis.ipynb): I really get  fascinated by good quality food being served in the restaurants and would like to help community find the best cuisines around their area like highly rated resturants locality wise, Cost Vs Rating etc.You can also access my blog [here](https://gurjeet333.medium.com/explanatory-data-analysis-of-zomato-restaurant-data-71ba8c3c7e5e)
  - [Olympics Dataset Analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/Data-Analysis-Using-Python/blob/main/olympics_dataset_analysis.ipynb): This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. In this notebook I use python to run some data exploration techniques to provid my view of viewing the dataset like understand the impact of Height,Weight and Age in winning the medals, Women participaiton over the years...etc.You can also access my blog [here](https://gurjeet333.medium.com/data-exploration-of-historical-olympics-dataset-2d50a7d0611d)
  - [Covid 19 Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/Data-Analysis-Using-Python/blob/main/Covid19-Analysis.ipynb): The below analysis is performed on Covid 19 Dataset which is freely avabliable on GitHub. I have tried performing analysis on various features to understand the spread of virus across various geographies and how the induvial countries have been impacted economically.My blog can be accessed [here](https://gurjeet333.medium.com/covid-19-explanatory-data-analysis-76cab46c48d1#ad87)
